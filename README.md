# scrabble
A rudimentary strategy tester for scrabble point maximizaiton
Working on creating simulations for the following strategies:
    max_bingo: each player plays all seven tiles each turn, stacking them vertically to maximize rescores
    max_build: each player plays one tile per turn, rescoring the maximum number of placed tiles
    will test with all z's first and then later with only valid words
